Dictionaries on Python

Dictionary is a type of Python Collection where it's key ordered
and any data containing python dictionary can be changed or replaced by it's key!
Dictionaries are appointed with curly brackets and it can contain strings,
numbers, another lists, tuples & dictionaries...

Let me show an example:
I'd like to assign "example = {
    "hello": {
        "world": 0,
        "hello": [
            0
        ]
    }
}"
list and let's see result...
